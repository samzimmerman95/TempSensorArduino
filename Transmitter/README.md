# Transmitter

Setup for sending temperature data remotely, powered from battery pack.

For local testing:
- Plug arduino into computer via USB so we can read Serial Monitor
- Remove wire from Vin pin. Do not want arduino powered by battery pack.
- Remove wire from pin 3. Do not want to send "Done" signal to power controller.
